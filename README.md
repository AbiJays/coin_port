# Crypto Currency Portfolio

An internet person has brought you their CryptoCurrency portfolio and an idea. With the aim to analyse their shares more effectively, you have been tasked to come up with an application to display their investments live.


## MVP

A user should be able to:

- View  the value of individual investments and the total GBP. 
- Add new currencies to portfolio via global view and portfolio view through.
- Increase/Decrease investments by adding transactions. Delete/Update with prompt.
- View all coins that are available to purchase through the app.
- For each coin, access the graph for global trends combined with Portfolio summary and transaction history for that coin.


## Achieved Extensions

- Log in with hard-coded password and timeout
- For each coin, access the graph for global trends combined with Portfolio summary and transaction history for that coin.

## Further Extensions

- Add extra timescales to global trends( 1hour, 1 week, 1 month,1 year?)
- Use historic prices and our stored transaction dates to display the value of our portfolio over time.
- Toggle between GBP or USD
- Delete/Update with prompt.
